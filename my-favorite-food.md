# My Favorite Food

Although there are many amazing foods out there from all over the globe, there is one region of the world that I find to be the best in the culinary field. With its fine blend of simple resources, masterful techniques and **deep tradition**, _southern_ American soul food is the best in its class. My grandmother always said
> There's nothing quite like the deep south cookin'

I have to agree with her on that point.
